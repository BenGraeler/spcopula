# spcopula

The spcopula package allows to model spatial and spatiotemporal random fields. 
The dependece strucutre is captured with the help of Vine Copulas in which the bivariate building blocks depend on the separating distances between the locations. 
The change in the strength of dependence can be continously modelled through a correlogram (also compare variogram in geostatistics/kriging) based on Kendall's tau.

The package has initilaly been developed through the DFG project "Developing Spatio-Temporal Copulas" at the Institue for Geoinformatics, University of Münster.
Is state can be rated as a "proof of concept", as it has evolved along a series of use-cases. 
However, it is supposed to be applicable to many other use-cases beyond these and has been used iń a number of scientific publications.
